| Reasons you should use GitHub:                       |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| Because it's a platform for chefs to share recipes   |
| Because it doesn't make collaboration easy           |
| Because it doesn't make my code portable             |
| Because I don't want backups for my code             |
| Because it's not cool or useful                      |
